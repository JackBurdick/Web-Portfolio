                        <h1>Background</h1>
                        <h3>Childhood</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was born on the west coast but grew up in the rural midwest.  Fishing, hunting, sports, and school consumed the majority of my time growing up.
                        </p>
                        <h3>U of M</h3>
                        <p>
                              I attended the University of Minnesota and completed a degree in biochemistry.  I originally planned to apply to medical school, but I didn't feel passionate about the subject and found myself wishing I had been an engineer or programmer.  After changing my mind, seemingly daily, on what I wanted to do post graduation I decided I was too invested in my biochem degree to start over.  I finished my biochem degree on the off chance I would decided to pursue professional school again.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Career</h3>
                        <p>
                            After graduation, I quickly started my career in the life sciences. (Un)fortunately, I never did feel the urge to pursue professional school again and so I terminated my job and returned to school for what I truly enjoyed.
                        </p>
                        <h3>FAU</h3>
                        <p>
                              I am just finishing my prerequists for a masters in computer engineering.  I enjoy the material far more than I previously did.  When I studied biochemsitry, some material caught my attention but I was never able to "practice" biochemistry outside of school.  Cloning, gene editing, viruses, prions, and transporter protiens are all wildly interesting to me, but since I wasn't able to clone anything in my kitchen (that I've disclosed anyway....) my excitement for the material would ____.  Computer engineering is totally different.  I am able to think of an idea and then, most importantly, I'm able to actually test it. I have numberous personal projects and in my free time am often reading textbooks "for fun".
                        </p>
                        <h3>Looking forward</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have a wide knowledge and experience base but think I'm finally moving toward a more well defined interest. From living in a city with a population under 500 and having a couple hundred acres of family woods, to living in a condo on Brickell ave in downtown Miami.  From carrying shingles up a two story ladder 8hours a day, to meeting with fitness fans, to designing and validating clinical genetic tests.  I continue to pursue what interests me and suspect my "base" will continue to grow before I finally figure out what it is I want to do.
